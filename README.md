KNIFE
=====
Simple source code analysis for dependency resolution. This is a bit of a foray into the world of
Java compiler tools for me. It's also the first time I've really used Guice, so sorry if it's a
bit messy.

KNIFE uses data driven testing with JUnit4 and Yaml-specced files to easily create system tests.

Will update this more further down the line.
